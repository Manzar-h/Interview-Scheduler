# Interview Scheduler

The Interview Scheduler project is a web application that allows users to schedule and manage interviews. The purpose of the project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for scheduling interviews, which can be used by both interviewers and interviewees. The application allows users to create and manage their own interview schedules and view upcoming interviews. It also allows users to reschedule or cancel interviews as needed. The application uses a calendar view to display scheduled interviews, making it easy for users to find and schedule available time slots.
